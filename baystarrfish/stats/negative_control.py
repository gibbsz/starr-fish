"""The negative-control contrast that turns a posterior into calls.

A fitted ``log_gamma`` is not directly a claim about activity: it is on an
arbitrary scale set jointly by the infection rate and the library abundance.
What is interpretable is the *contrast* between a target cCRE and the negative
controls in the same cell type, evaluated draw by draw so the uncertainty in
both terms is carried through::

    contrast_d = log_gamma[d, s, j] - mean_{j' in controls} log_gamma[d, s, j']
                 - effect_threshold

    p_right = P(contrast <= 0)          # posterior tail probability
    q_right = BH(p_right)

Because the contrast is formed inside each posterior draw, the control mean's
own uncertainty is subtracted correctly rather than being treated as a fixed
offset.

Eligibility is a T7 filter, not a cCRE filter: a (cell type, cCRE) pair with too
little constitutive signal has no evidence either way, and including it would
report the prior as a result. Cell types whose controls collectively fail the
filter are dropped entirely -- there is no reference to contrast against.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_gamma : (n_draws, n_groups, n_cre)
        Posterior draws of log activity.
    target_indices, control_indices : int arrays
        Columns of ``log_gamma`` to test and to use as the reference.
    t7_totals : (n_groups, n_cre)
        Per-pair constitutive-channel totals driving the eligibility filter.
    t7_threshold
        Minimum T7 total for a target pair, and for the pooled control total
        when ``individual_control_t7_threshold`` is None.
    effect_threshold
        Minimum log-fold effect over the control reference to call; shifts the
        null rather than filtering after the fact.
    individual_control_t7_threshold
        If given, controls are filtered individually at this threshold and the
        reference is the mean over the survivors, instead of requiring the pooled
        control total to pass ``t7_threshold``.
    control_sd_multiplier
        Raise the reference by ``k`` control standard deviations (per draw) for a
        stricter null. Requires at least two surviving controls.

    Returns a tidy frame with one row per tested (cell type, cCRE) pair.
